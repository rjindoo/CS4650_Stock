# CS4650_Stock

To start this project I made two LSTM models to predict general trends of stock labels and combined this information with general news articles to make decisions for stock purchases. I plan to attempt a different machine learning model for the next week of this project and will continue to reinforce my models predictions with news articles from sources such as CNBC, MarketWatch, NYTimes, and MotleyFool.
