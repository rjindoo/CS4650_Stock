Week 1:
To start this project I made two LSTM models to predict general trends of stock labels and combined this information with general news articles to make decisions for stock purchases. I plan to attempt a different machine learning model for the next week of this project and will continue to reinforce my models predictions with news articles from sources such as CNBC, MarketWatch, NYTimes, and MotleyFool.

Week 2:
I decided to look into different factors that could affect price, so instead of immediately writing a new model, I performed data analysis on balance sheets, financial statements, and stock price trends in order to collect data that could be utilized in a machine learning model.
